A perfect blend of annotations and convention, zeroC offers a scalable featured framework for CFML applications. Instead of being a central controller framework zeroC allows a developer to arrange his/her application the way they see fit. Use zeroC as little or as much as you want. zeroC offers scaffolding all the way to a suite of tags that helps your code be portable between Adobe's ColdFusion and New Atlanta's BlueDragon.
